## About Me

Hi! I am currently a postdoc at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Cong Wang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~congwang/). 
I received my dual Ph.D. from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) and [Xi'an Jiaotong Univeristy](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Cong Wang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~congwang/) and [Prof. Chao Shen](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/cshen/english).
I also had a wonderful time in [Qihoo 360](http://www.360.cn/about/englishversion.html) as a research intern in 2018.
Before that, I obtained B.Eng. and B.B.A. from Xi'an Jiaotong University.

My research lies at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI. Currently, I am focused on analyzing new attack surfaces introduced by AI components and exploring how AI can be leveraged to enhance existing security measures.
